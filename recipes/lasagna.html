            <li>Now, it's time to assemble the lasagna. In a greased 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a small amount of the ricotta mixture on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the ricotta mixture.</li>
            <li>Add a layer of mozzarella cheese slices.</li>

            <li>Sprinkle more of the herb and spice mixture over the mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Add a final layer of lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li>Top the lasagna with any remaining mozzarella cheese slices and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 25-30 minutes, or until the lasagna is bubbly and the top is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
