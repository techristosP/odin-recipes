            <li>4 tablespoon(s) olive oil</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Thyme, fresh</li>
            <li>3-4 clove(s) of garlic</li>
            <li>1 chicken bouillon cube</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon(s) oregano, dry</li>
            <li>Lemon juice, of 2 lemons</li>
            <li>Lemon zest, of 2 lemons</li>
            <li>50 g olive oil</li>
            <li>200 g water</li>
            <li>Thyme, fresh</li>
            <li>40 g honey</li>
            <li>60 g mustard, mild</li>
            <li>1 chicken, cut into 8 portions</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon(s) strained yogurt</li>
        </ul>

        <ol><b class="bold">Steps:</b>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200* C (390* F) Fan.</li>
            <li>Peel the potatoes and chop them into wedges.</li>
            <li>Place a frying pan over high heat and add olive oil.</li>
            <li>When it gets very hot, add the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Add salt, pepper, and a few sprigs of fresh thyme.</li>
            <li>Sauté until golden.</li>
            <li>When ready, transfer to an ovenproof baking dish and set aside until needed.</li>
            <li>Beat the garlic, bouillon cube, oregano, lemon rind, lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, water, honey, mustard, and a generous amount of thyme in a food processor, until the garlic completely breaks down and all of the ingredients are combined.</li>
            <li>It is better to wear disposable gloves when working with raw chicken.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken in a large bowl and pour the marinade over it.</li>
            <li>Massage it onto the chicken until it is completely coated.</li>
            <li>You can cook it immediately or refrigerate and let it marinate for up to 1 ½ days. The longer you let the marinade work on the chicken, the tastier it will turn out!</li>
            <li>When ready to cook, place chicken over the potatoes in the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Drizzle any remaining marinade over the chicken and potatoes and cover with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Roast for 45 minutes, remove aluminum foil and roast for another 30-45 minutes, basting the chicken with the marinade and juices as often as possible.</li>
            <li>When ready, serve the chicken and the potatoes with Greek strained yogurt.</li>            
        </ol>
